  Here is the description of this theme ...
baseurl: "/basicproject" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://tomjohnson1492.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
twitter_username: tomjohnson
github_username:  tomjohnson1492
host: 127.0.0.1 # specified here because 0.0.0 gets defaulted to search in Chrome.
port: 4001 # specified here in case you have multiple sites and want to view them simultaneously (you'll need different ports)


## single sourcing toggles: here you set some variables that will be used as toggles for single sourcing projects. If you just have one site, you can probably ignore these two fields. 
# But the theme is designed to generate multiple outputs from the same theme -- this is the paradigm of single sourcing that is common to the tech writer's world but which isn't so
# common in the Jekyll world.
