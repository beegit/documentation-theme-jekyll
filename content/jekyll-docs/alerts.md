## Notes

For notes, warnings, important, info, etc., use these styles:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger"><h4>Another test</h4>this is a test v2 </div>

{{calloutdanger}}
<h4>This is a warning</h4>whatever you do, do not trip while getting off a skyscraper's viewpoint platform.
{{end}}



```html
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-default">
  <h4>Default Callout</h4>
  This is a default callout.
</div>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-primary">
  <h4>Primary Callout</h4>

</div>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-success">
