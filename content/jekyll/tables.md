If you create tables in Markdown, you can't add classes to them. If you create them in HTML, you of course can add classes. 

## Markdown Table format

<pre>
| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
</pre>


If you want to right or left align the table, use the `:` on the side of the bar you want to align it.

<pre>
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
</pre>
