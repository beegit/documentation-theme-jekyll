The sidebar and top navigation bar read their values from yml files inside the _data folder. Follow the YML syntax shown in the file. You can only nest content two levels, not three. If you want the URL to point to an external site, use <code>external&#95;url</code> instead of `url`.

The sidebar.yml file also includes a value that lets you choose whether to use the accordion feature in the sidebar or not.
