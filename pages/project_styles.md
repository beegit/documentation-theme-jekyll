You can specify custom stylesheets and JS scripts for each project. Assuming you have multiple configuration files (one per project), put custom stylesheets inside the css folder, and custom scripts inside the js folder. In the configuration file, specify the names of the stylesheets or js files in the `project_css` and `project_js` values.
