{% include_relative reuse/variables.html %}
Although you can get started with this theme by simply gutting the existing jekyll-docs theme and replacing it with your own content and values, that's not how I intended this theme to be used. I'm assuming that you may have multiple projects that you'll be publishing, and that you want to use the theme as a template for each project. As such, you can simply leave the jekyll-doc content as is. The following steps explain how to create a new project for the theme.

{{alertprimary}} In these instructions, to simplify things, I'm assuming your project's name is "ACME." Customize these instructions to swap in your real project name.{{end}}

To publish a new project with the jekyll-doc theme, do the following:

## Clone the jekyll-doc repository

1. `mkdir acme`
2. `cd acme`
3. git clone `https://github.com/tomjohnson1492/jekyll-doc.git .`

## Copy the blankproject folder inside projects

1. Inside the projects folder, copy the "blankproject" folder and paste it (duplicating it). Don't just rename it or it messes up future `git pull` requests. Once you copy the blankproject folder, change the name to your project's name -- in this case, I'll assume "acme" is your project name.

## Customize the configuration
1. In the projects/acme/configurations folder, rename config_blankproject.yml to config_acme.yml.
2. Open config_acme.yml and customize all the values. The file contains notes for each part you need to customize. Basically everywhere you see "blankproject", change it to your project's name. 

## Customize the pages
1. Open the pages folder inside acme. Here is where you add your pages. Leave the reuse and drafts folders there. You add links, callouts, and notes by referencing the content in the reuse folders. You must include {% raw %}`{% include_relative reuse/variables.html %}` {% endraw %} where you want to have any of these resources available on the page.
2. Open the footer.md and home.md pages. Change the id from `blankproject-homepage` and `blankproject-footer` to `acme-homepage` and `acme-footer`.

## Customize data

1. In the data folder, sidebar.yml contains the sidebar navigation for the sidebar and topnav.yml contains the navigation for the top navigation bar. The current values are for the jekyll-doc theme, so you can see some example formatting. Change these values with your own page titles and URLs. Spacing matters in YML syntax.
2. In data/options.yml, you can use this file to set other options for running conditional logic in your content. There's an example shown there.

## Customize the build script

1. In the root directory, copy the blankproject.sh and paste it (duplicating it). Change the duplicated filename to acme.sh.
2. Open acme.sh (in a text editor) and change all instances of `blankproject` to `acme`. (There are 3 instances to change.)

## Build your site

`cd` to your project folder.
Type `. acme.sh`.

{{calloutprimary}} You can run `git pull` to get updates to the theme. The updates will not overwrite your other project files that you have *added* (not customized). For example, the updates from the theme won't overwrite anything in content/acme. However, if you change content in content/blankproject, the updates will overwrite that folder. In short, if your cloned repo has files A,B,C, D, E, F, and the repo has only files A, B, C, then only A, B, C, will be overwritten when you pull new updates. However, if you change A to B, and you run `git pull`, then there will be a conflict. This is why you must duplicate the blankproject folder instead of merely changing its filename. I won't add any new subfolders under projects other than jekyll-doc and blankproject.{{end}}
