<!--

Ideally I would have put a folder here called includes. However, you can't define a different include source in the config file. 

Additionally, the include_relative tag didn't seem to work. As a result, includes aren't contained within the project. They are
in the _includes directory. However, the configuration file has an includes_directory property that allows you to specify the source
for the project's includes directory. Point it to a subdirectory inside the _includes file that corresponds with your project's name.
